# Toxic-Comments-Classifier
Created a web app which will classify comments into 6 different classes (Multi Label). Used NLP preprocessing techniques and ML &amp; DL models for training.

## Problem Statement :
The prevalence of online toxicity has become a growing concern in social media platforms, and it can negatively impact individuals and communities. In this project, i have worked with a toxic comment classification dataset that includes comments labeled with multiple toxic classes, and used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a multilabel predictive model.

Algorithms Used :- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,  Multinomial Naive Bayes, XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boost, RNN, LSTM, GRU.

### Project Steps

1) Exploration of data using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and plotly.

2) Data Preprocessing :- Tried varies data preprocessing techniques
